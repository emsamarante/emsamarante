# Hi, I am Eduardo :nerd_face:
I am a dedicated Data Analyst, fully committed to problem-solving and providing valuable insights to support decision-making. My expertise lies in data analysis using statistical methods, and I have a strong foundation in implementing data warehouses, data modeling, and data lakes. I excel in creating comprehensive reports and dynamic dashboards that enable informed choices.

With a background in mathematics and Earth Science, I bring a unique skill set to the field of data analysis. I am results-oriented and continuously seek opportunities for professional growth in the complexities of data analysis and personal development.

I pride myself on being highly adaptable and resourceful, and I excel in communicating complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences. I am fluent in Portuguese and possess a strong command of the English language.

Currently, I am seeking an opportunity to contribute and grow with a company in Canada, where I can apply my expertise and add value to the organization's data-driven initiatives.
